## Routing 

Next.js has a file system based routing system.

URLs you can access in your browser are determined by how you orgainze your file and folders in your code.

### Routing conventions

1. All routes must live inside the app folder
2. Route files must be named either page.js or page.tsx
   
   When these conventions are followed , the file automatically becomes available as a route.
